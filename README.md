- Not a PR because goals are very different and that project seems pretty dead to me.

- Everything might radically change so I will update things as I go. (Along with documentation etc etc)

- Attempt to learn and recreate experiments from Stephen wolframs book (A new kind of science) 
- Ongoing personal attempt to experiment with automata.
